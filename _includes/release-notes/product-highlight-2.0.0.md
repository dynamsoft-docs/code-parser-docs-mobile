* `DynamsoftCodeParser` SDK has been revamped to integrate with `DynamsoftCaptureVision (DCV)` architecture, which is newly established to aggregate the features of functional products powered by Dynamsoft. The features are designed to be pluggable, customizable and interactable. In addition, the functional products share the computation so that their processing speed is much higher than working individually.
* Added Mobile Editions. With these new editions, developers can effortlessly integrate code parsing capabilities into their Android and iOS applications.
* Added supports to parse following code types:
  * MRTD_TD1_ID
  * MRTD_TD2_ID
  * MRTD_TD2_VISA

  * VIN
  * AAMVA_DL_ID
  * AAMVA_DL_ID_WITH_MAG_STRIPE
